DECORATOR_CORRELATION RULES:

Use decorateByKey() when correlating events by matching correlation IDs (requestId, traceId, spanId, transactionId, threadId).

SYNTAX:
  events/<type> | decorateByKey(<decorator-type>, key=<key-path>, decoratorKey=<decorator-key-path>, fields=<field1>,<field2>,...)

KEY POINTS:
1. Key-based matching: Events are joined where key == decoratorKey
2. Common keys: threadId (eventThread/javaThreadId), requestId, traceId, spanId
3. Decorator fields accessed with $decorator. prefix
4. Useful for distributed tracing and request correlation

COMMON PATTERNS:
- "samples with requestId" → decorateByKey matching on thread ID to get request context
- "allocations with traceId" → decorateByKey for distributed tracing correlation
- "events for transaction X" → decorateByKey matching on transactionId

EXAMPLES OF KEY-BASED CORRELATION:
- Execution samples with request context (requestId, endpoint)
- Allocations with distributed trace IDs (traceId, spanId)
- Top endpoints by CPU usage with request metadata
- Transaction-scoped event analysis
