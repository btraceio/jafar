DECORATOR_TEMPORAL RULES:

Use decorateByTime() when correlating events that overlap in time on the same thread.

SYNTAX:
  events/<type> | decorateByTime(<decorator-type>, fields=<field1>,<field2>,...)

KEY POINTS:
1. Temporal overlap: Events must occur during the same time period on the same thread
2. Decorator fields are accessed with $decorator. prefix
3. Can be combined with groupBy and aggregations
4. Use filters on decorator type: decorateByTime(jdk.GCPhase[name="Mark"], ...)

COMMON PATTERNS:
- "methods during X" → decorateByTime to find code executing during X events
- "allocations while Y" → decorateByTime to correlate allocations with Y
- "samples when Z" → decorateByTime for temporal correlation with Z

EXAMPLES OF TEMPORAL CORRELATION:
- Methods causing virtual thread pinning
- Code executing during GC phases
- Activity during long safepoint pauses
- Thread parks overlapping with I/O operations
