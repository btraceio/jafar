METADATA_QUERY Category Rules:

Use metadata/ root for queries about event type structure, fields, and discovery.

WHEN TO USE:
- "what fields does X have?"
- "describe Y event"
- "show structure of Z"
- "what event types match pattern?"
- "list all events with X in the name"

PATTERNS:

1. Specific event type:
   metadata/jdk.ExecutionSample
   - Use when user asks about ONE specific event type

2. Wildcard/pattern matching:
   metadata/[name ~ 'REGEX_PATTERN']
   - Use when user asks about MULTIPLE event types
   - Use when query includes wildcards: *, .*, "like", "matching"
   - Use when asking about a namespace: "jdk.*", "all X events"

   Examples:
   - "events like *ExecutionSample" → metadata/[name ~ '.*ExecutionSample']
   - "all Allocation events" → metadata/[name ~ '.*Allocation.*']
   - "jdk.* events" → metadata/[name ~ 'jdk\\..*']
   - "GC-related types" → metadata/[name ~ '.*GC.*|.*Garbage.*']

3. All event types:
   metadata
   - Use when asking for ALL event types in recording
   - "how many event types", "list all types"

REGEX TIPS:
- .* matches any characters
- \. matches literal dot (escape it!)
- | is OR operator
- ^ is start of string, $ is end
- Case sensitive by default

CONFIDENCE:
- High (0.95+): Specific event type name
- Medium (0.85-0.95): Pattern matching, wildcards
- Lower (0.80-0.85): Complex regex, multiple patterns
