Q: "which threads allocated the most memory?"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.ObjectAllocationSample | groupBy(eventThread/javaName, agg=sum, value=bytes) | top(10, by=sum)", "explanation": "Groups allocation events by thread and sums the bytes allocated, then shows the top 10 threads", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "top allocating classes"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.ObjectAllocationSample | groupBy(objectClass/name, agg=sum, value=weight) | top(10, by=sum)", "explanation": "Groups allocations by class name and sums the allocation weight", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "show file reads over 1MB"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.FileRead[bytes>1048576]", "explanation": "Filters file read events to those larger than 1MB (1048576 bytes)", "confidence": 0.98}

Q: "count GC events"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.GarbageCollection | count()", "explanation": "Counts total garbage collection events", "confidence": 0.98}

Q: "average GC pause time"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.GarbageCollection | stats(duration)", "explanation": "Calculates statistics for GC pause durations including average", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "show network read events"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.SocketRead", "explanation": "Selects all socket read events for network I/O analysis", "confidence": 0.98}

Q: "network reads larger than 1KB"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.SocketRead[bytesRead>1024]", "explanation": "Filters socket reads by bytesRead field (note: different from file bytes)", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "file writes over 5MB"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.FileWrite[bytesWritten>5242880]", "explanation": "Filters file writes by bytesWritten field (note: FileWrite uses bytesWritten not bytes)", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "slow compilations over 1 second"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.Compilation[duration>1000000000]", "explanation": "Filters compilation events longer than 1 second (1 billion nanoseconds)", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "statistics on object allocation sizes"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.ObjectAllocationSample | stats(weight)", "explanation": "Computes statistics (min, max, avg, count) on allocation weight field", "confidence": 0.95}

Q: "network traffic by remote address"
A: {"query": "events/jdk.SocketRead | groupBy(address, agg=sum, value=bytesRead)", "explanation": "Groups socket reads by remote address and sums bytes read", "confidence": 0.95}
